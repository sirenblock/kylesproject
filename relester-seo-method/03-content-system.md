## The FAQ Format (Critical for Rich Results)

### How to Write FAQs in CMS Content

```html
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>What is [primary topic]?</strong></p>
<p>[Direct answer in 2-3 sentences. Be factual and concise. Include the primary keyword naturally.]</p>

<p><strong>How much does [topic] cost?</strong></p>
<p>[Answer with specific ranges and factors that affect price. Include dollar amounts.]</p>

<p><strong>How long does [process] take?</strong></p>
<p>[Realistic timeframe with explanation of what affects duration.]</p>

<p><strong>Do I need [common requirement]?</strong></p>
<p>[Yes/No with explanation. Be direct first, then elaborate.]</p>

<p><strong>What are the benefits of [topic]?</strong></p>
<p>[2-3 key benefits with brief explanations. Specific over general.]</p>

<p><strong>Can I [DIY aspect] myself?</strong></p>
<p>[Honest answer about feasibility and when professional help is needed.]</p>

<p><strong>[Long-tail keyword question]?</strong></p>
<p>[Answer targeting a "People Also Ask" query from Google.]</p>
```

### FAQ Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Count | 5-9 questions per post (sweet spot for schema) |
| Question format | `<p><strong>Question?</strong></p>` |
| Answer format | Separate `<p>` tag immediately after question |
| Answer length | 40-60 words (concise but complete) |
| Question ending | Must end with `?` |
| Keyword targeting | Each question targets a long-tail keyword variation |
| Research source | Google's "People Also Ask" for your target keyword |
| Uniqueness | No duplicate questions across posts |

### FAQ Extraction Pattern

The system automatically extracts FAQs from CMS content to generate schema:

1. **First:** Look for embedded `<script type="application/ld+json">` with `@type: FAQPage`
2. **Fallback:** Parse `<strong>Question?</strong>` + next `<p>` answer pattern
3. **Result:** Array of `{ question, answer }` objects
4. **Used for:** FAQPage JSON-LD schema + BlogFAQ accordion component

### FAQ Section Removal from Content

After extracting FAQs, remove them from the main article body (they get rendered by the BlogFAQ component instead):

```tsx
function removeFaqSection(html, faqs) {
  // Remove the FAQ heading and everything after it
  let result = html.replace(/<h2[^>]*>([^<]*FAQ[^<]*)<\/h2>([\s\S]*?)(?=<h2|$)/i, '')
  // Remove individual Q&A pairs
  for (const faq of faqs) {
    const escapedQ = faq.question.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&')
    const pattern = new RegExp(
      `<p[^>]*>\\s*<strong[^>]*>${escapedQ}\\s*<\\/strong>\\s*<\\/p>\\s*<p[^>]*>[\\s\\S]*?<\\/p>`,
      'gi'
    )
    result = result.replace(pattern, '')
  }
  return result
}
```

## On-Page SEO Rules

### Title Tag (Meta Title)

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Length | 50-60 characters (Google truncates at ~60) |
| Primary keyword | In the first half of the title |
| Brand name | Appended automatically via layout template or ` \| Brand` |
| Uniqueness | Every page has a different title |
| Format | `Primary Keyword - Benefit or Hook` or `Topic: Subtitle` |

### Meta Description

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Length | 150-160 characters |
| Primary keyword | Included naturally |
| CTA | Implicit call to action ("Learn...", "Discover...", "Get...") |
| Uniqueness | Every page has a different description |
| Template | `Learn [topic] for [audience]. This guide covers [points]. [Benefit].` |

### URL Slug

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Format | `kebab-case` (lowercase, hyphens) |
| Length | 3-6 words |
| Keyword | Primary keyword included |
| Stop words | Remove "the", "a", "and", "of", "in", "for" |
| Permanence | NEVER change after publishing without adding 301 redirect |

### Heading Hierarchy

| Level | Usage | Count per Post |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| H1 | Post/page title | Exactly 1 |
| H2 | Major sections | 6-10 |
| H3 | Subsections within H2 | 2-4 per H2 |
| H4 | Rare, deep subsections | 0-2 total |

**Rules:**
- Never skip levels (H1 → H3 without H2)
- H2 headings become Table of Contents entries
- Add `id` attributes to H2/H3 for anchor links
- Each H2 should target a related keyword cluster

### Keyword Placement Priority

1. **Title (H1)** - Primary keyword, preferably first few words
2. **Meta title** - Primary keyword, front-loaded
3. **Meta description** - Primary + secondary keyword
4. **URL slug** - Primary keyword
5. **First paragraph** - Primary keyword in first 100 words
6. **2-3 H2 headings** - Primary and secondary keywords
7. **Image alt text** - Keyword where natural
8. **FAQ questions** - Long-tail keyword variations
9. **Density** - 1-2% for primary keyword. Write naturally.

### Internal Linking Rules

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Links per article | 2-4 contextual internal links |
| Conversion link | 1 link to contact/form/service page |
| Anchor text | Descriptive (not "click here" or "read more") |
| Direction | Link both newer → older AND older → newer |
| Authority flow | Link from high-traffic pages to new content |

### Image Rules

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Featured image | Required on every post |
| Featured dimensions | 1200x630px (OG image compatible) |
| Inline images | 2-5 per post |
| Alt text | Required on ALL images, descriptive, include keyword if natural |
| Format | AVIF primary, WebP fallback (via Next.js Image) |
| Loading | `priority` on featured/hero, lazy on everything else |
| CMS override | Use `width: 100% !important` in CSS to override inline styles |

## Content Sanitization Pipeline

When pulling content from any CMS, run it through this pipeline before rendering:

```tsx
function sanitizeContent(html: string) {
  let cleaned = html

  // 1. Remove old embedded JSON-LD schema blocks
  cleaned = removeSchemaBlocks(cleaned)

  // 2. Remove old platform embed wrappers (Webflow, etc.)
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(
    /<div[^>]*class="[^"]*w-embed[^"]*"[^>]*>[\s\S]*?<\/div>/gi,
    ''
  )

  // 3. Convert absolute URLs to relative (fix domain references)
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(
    /https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?yourdomain\.com\//g,
    '/'
  )

  // 4. Fix old platform URLs (Webflow, staging, etc.)
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(
    /https?:\/\/your-old-platform\.com\//g,
    '/'
  )

  // 5. Remove empty paragraphs (including zero-width joiners)
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(
    /<p[^>]*>\s*(<br\s*\/?>|\s|&nbsp;|\u200d)*\s*<\/p>/gi,
    ''
  )

  // 6. Remove old CMS class wrappers (keep contents)
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(
    /<div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">/g,
    '<div>'
  )

  // 7. Remove empty embedded divs
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(
    /<div\s+data-rt-embed-type[^>]*>[\s\S]*?<\/div>/gi,
    ''
  )

  // 8. Remove Google Docs links (migration artifact)
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(
    /<p[^>]*>\s*https?:\/\/docs\.google\.com\/[^<]*<\/p>/gi,
    ''
  )

  return cleaned
}
```

### Heading Extraction for Table of Contents

```tsx
function extractHeadings(html: string) {
  const headings = []
  const regex = /<h([23])[^>]*>(?:<strong[^>]*>)?([^<]+)(?:<\/strong>)?<\/h[23]>/gi
  let match
  while ((match = regex.exec(html)) !== null) {
    const text = decodeHtmlEntities(match[2]).trim()
    const id = text
      .toLowerCase()
      .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')
      .replace(/^-|-$/g, '')
    headings.push({ id, text, level: parseInt(match[1]) })
  }
  return headings
}

function addHeadingIds(html: string) {
  return html.replace(
    /<h([23])([^>]*)>((?:<strong[^>]*>)?[^<]+(?:<\/strong>)?)<\/h[23]>/gi,
    (_match, level, attrs, innerHtml) => {
      const text = innerHtml.replace(/<\/?strong[^>]*>/g, '').trim()
      const id = text.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-').replace(/^-|-$/g, '')
      return `<h${level}${attrs} id="${id}">${innerHtml}</h${level}>`
    }
  )
}
```

---

## Location Page Content

Short programmatic SEO pages targeting `[service] in [city]` searches.

### Specs

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Word count | 200-400 words |
| Slug format | `service-type-in-city-state` |
| H1 | `[Service] in [City], [State]` |
| Schema | LocalBusiness with areaServed |
| Sitemap priority | 0.5 |
| Scale | 100-200+ pages from one template |

### Content Structure

The CMS content for location pages is minimal. The page template adds:
- Hero section with city name
- Sidebar with contact card, service links, resource links
- CTA block with phone number and form link

The CMS just provides a few paragraphs of localized service description.

### Slug Prefix System

Use multiple slug prefixes to capture different keyword variations people search for. Replace `[your-keyword]` with your niche terms:

```
[primary-service]-in-[city]-[state]
[primary-service]-services-in-[city]-[state]
[primary-service]-design-in-[city]-[state]
[primary-service]-requirements-in-[city]-[state]
[secondary-service]-in-[city]-[state]
[secondary-service]-services-in-[city]-[state]
[service-specialist]-in-[city]-[state]
```

**Examples by niche:**
- Plumbing: `plumbing-services-in-`, `emergency-plumber-in-`, `drain-repair-in-`
- Legal: `personal-injury-lawyer-in-`, `family-law-attorney-in-`, `legal-services-in-`
- Solar: `solar-permit-services-in-`, `solar-design-in-`, `solar-permitting-in-`
- HVAC: `hvac-services-in-`, `ac-repair-in-`, `heating-installation-in-`

This captures the full range of how people search for local services in your niche.

---

## Service Page Content

Service pages are short because the page template handles most visual content.

### Specs

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Word count | 300-500 words from CMS |
| Template adds | Feature cards, process steps, contact form, FAQ accordion |
| Schema | FAQPage |
| Sitemap priority | 0.7 |

---

## Content Quality Signals

### Word Count Targets by Type

| Post Type | Target Words | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| How-To Guide | 3,000-3,500 | Thorough but not bloated |
| Comparison | 3,500-4,000 | Needs space for both sides + comparison table |
| Regional/Regulatory | 4,000-4,500 | Detail-heavy, reference-rich |
| Troubleshooting | 5,000-5,500 | Must cover all edge cases |
| Listicle/Cost | 3,200-3,500 | Numbered items keep it focused |

### E-E-A-T Signals (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)

- **Person schema** with jobTitle and worksFor (establishes expertise)
- **Specific data and numbers** (not vague generalities)
- **Publication dates** visible on posts (shows freshness)
- **Professional design** (builds subconscious trust)
- **Internal links** to related authoritative content
- **External links** to official sources (government sites, industry standards)

### Formatting for Scanability

- **Bold** key terms and important phrases
- **Bullet lists** for features, benefits, requirements (3-7 items)
- **Numbered lists** for steps and processes
- **Tables** for comparisons and data
- **Short paragraphs** (2-4 sentences maximum)
- **Subheadings every 200-300 words**
