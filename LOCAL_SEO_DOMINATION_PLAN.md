# 30A JUNK REMOVAL - COMPLETE LOCAL SEO DOMINATION PLAN
## Relester Method + Content Strategy Combined

**Current State:** 85/100 Relester Compliance | 193 pages indexed | NO local presence
**Target State:** 95/100 Relester Compliance | 350+ pages indexed | Dominating Local Pack

## CRITICAL INSIGHT: Content Alone Won't Win Local SEO

**The Gap:** You can have 1,000 pages of perfect content, but without these, you won't rank locally:
1. ❌ Google Business Profile (GBP)
2. ❌ Google Reviews (0 reviews)
3. ❌ Local Citations (NAP on 10+ directories)
4. ❌ Trust Signals (photos, videos, testimonials)

**Relester Method Truth:** Local SEO = 40% On-Site + 60% Off-Site

**Resource: 10-15 hours/week**

## TRACK 2: ON-SITE CONTENT SEO
