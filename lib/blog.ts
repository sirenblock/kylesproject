| 1/4 Truck | $150-$225 | Single couch, dresser |
| 1/2 Truck | $275-$375 | Bedroom set |
| 3/4 Truck | $400-$500 | Living room furniture |
| Full Truck | $550-$700 | Garage cleanout |

Construction debris typically starts at $600 due to weight-based disposal fees.

# 5 Vacation Rental Cleanout Tips Every 30A Property Manager Needs

Managing vacation rentals along 30A means dealing with the inevitable: furniture breaks, appliances fail, and guests leave behind more than just memories. Here's how to handle cleanouts efficiently.

## The Challenge of Rental Turnovers

With peak season bringing weekly turnovers, property managers need reliable systems for handling:

- Damaged furniture that can't be repaired
- Worn-out mattresses (the 3-year rule applies)
- Broken grills and patio furniture
- Accumulated "junk drawers" worth of items
- Left-behind belongings (after the 30-day hold period)

## Tip 1: Schedule Recurring Junk Removal

Instead of waiting for emergencies, schedule quarterly cleanouts for each property. This prevents accumulation and keeps properties guest-ready.

**Best Practice:** End-of-season (November) and pre-season (February) are ideal times for thorough cleanouts.

## Tip 2: Create a "Removal Ready" Staging Area

Designate a spot in each property (garage, utility room, or outdoor storage) where items awaiting removal can be staged. This:

- Keeps unsightly items out of guest areas
- Makes junk removal visits more efficient
- Helps track what needs to go

## Tip 3: Document Everything

Before scheduling removal:
- Take photos of items for owner approval
- Note any items that might have resale/donation value
- Keep records for property expense tracking

## Tip 4: Build a Relationship with Your Junk Removal Service

A reliable junk removal partner who knows your properties can:
- Respond quickly to emergencies
- Understand your specific needs
- Offer property management pricing
- Work within your turnover schedule

## Tip 5: Know What Requires Special Handling

Some items need special attention:

### Standard Removal:
- Furniture
- Mattresses
- Appliances
- Electronics
- General household items

### Special Handling Required:
- Hot tubs (requires disconnection)
- Construction materials
- Hazardous materials (paint, chemicals)
- Large outdoor structures

## The Bottom Line

Efficient junk removal is part of successful property management. With the right systems in place, you can maintain pristine properties and keep guests happy.

# Construction Debris Removal in 30A: What Homeowners Need to Know

Renovating your 30A beach home is exciting, but dealing with the debris? Not so much. Whether you're updating a kitchen in Rosemary Beach or gutting a bathroom in WaterColor, here's your complete guide to construction debris removal.

## Why Construction Debris Costs More

You might wonder why construction debris removal costs more than regular junk removal. Here's the breakdown:

### Weight Matters
Construction materials are significantly heavier than household items:
- Drywall: 1.5-2 lbs per square foot
- Tile: 4-5 lbs per square foot
- Concrete: 150 lbs per cubic foot
- Lumber: 2-4 lbs per linear foot

### Disposal Fees
Landfills charge by weight for construction materials, and some require special processing.

### Sorting Requirements
Many materials need to be sorted for proper disposal or recycling:
- Clean wood → recycling
- Drywall → specific facilities
- Metal → scrap recycling
- Mixed debris → construction landfill

## Common 30A Renovation Projects and Costs

| Project | Typical Debris | Estimated Removal |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Kitchen Remodel | Cabinets, countertops, flooring | $600-$800 |
| Bathroom Gut | Tile, vanity, fixtures, drywall | $600-$750 |
| Flooring Replacement | Old flooring, underlayment | $400-$600 |
| Deck Removal | Lumber, railings, hardware | $500-$900 |
| Full Room Renovation | Mixed materials | $800-$1,200+ |

## How to Get an Accurate Quote

The best way to get an accurate quote for construction debris:

1. **Take Photos** - Multiple angles showing the scope
2. **Measure the Space** - Square footage of affected areas
3. **List Materials** - What's being removed (tile, drywall, etc.)
4. **Note Access** - Stairs, narrow doorways, long carries

Text us photos and we'll respond with a quote within 30 minutes.

## Timing Your Debris Removal

### During the Project
Some contractors prefer ongoing removal to keep the work area clean. This typically involves:
- Weekly scheduled pickups
- Designated staging area
- Coordination with contractor schedule

Most homeowners opt for a single post-project removal:
- More cost-effective
- Contractor stages everything
- One-time scheduling
